            <p style="text-align:justify;">After my Engineering Undergrad, I started my career with CGI. I worked for two and a half years as an IT consultant and supported various telecom, IT projects for clients in Canada, the UK, and a few European countries. Then I moved to Honeywell Aerospace, where I worked for four years in product development, program management for avionics programs. I managed product schedule, risk, multimillion-dollar budget, and end-to-end product development. During summer 2019, I worked at Dassault Systemes as a High-Tech business consultant focusing on digital transformation and modular product portfolio strategy for telecom OEMs, white goods, and semiconductor clients. I recently worked as an IFC Climate Fellow at World Bank Group, where I developed a business case and conducted market research for Carbon capture technology. I am currently working at The Arena Inc for special projects - Data Analytics(Part-time) focusing on SEO, Product Analytics, and go-to-market product launch.</p>
