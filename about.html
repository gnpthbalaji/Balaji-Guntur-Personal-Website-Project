            <p style="text-align:justify;">After my Engineering Undergrad, I started my career with CGI, where I worked for 2 and half years as an IT consultant and supported various telecom, IT projects for clients in Canada, the UK and few European countries. Then I moved to Honeywell Aerospace, where I worked for four years in product development, program management for avionics programs. I managed product schedule, risk, multimillion-dollar budget and end-to-end product development. During the summer 2019 , I worked at Dassault systemes as High-Tech business consultant with a focus towards digital transformation and modular product portfolio strategy for telecom OEMs, white goods, and semiconductor clients. I recently worked as IFC Climate Fellow at World Bank Group. </p>
