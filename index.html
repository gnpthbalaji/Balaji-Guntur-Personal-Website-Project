            <h3 style="text-align:left;">Hey there!</h3>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">Welcome to my website. My name is <strong>Balaji Guntur</strong>. I am a recent MBA graduate from Georgetown University, and I also have a bachelor’s degree in engineering.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I love to solve challenging problems.</strong> Whether it is developing and managing a product with various product constraints and requirements or figuring out how to make the PowerPoint presentation visually attractive and useful for the Clients and Stakeholders. I love the challenge of adapting to ever-changing situations.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I love to collaborate with a wide variety of people.</strong> One thing that I learned from my previous work experience and my MBA is collaborating and finding a way collectively to achieve the North Star metric or business objective. </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I love to be out of my comfort zone.</strong> I believe nobody can ever ask more than what we are capable of, maybe that’s why I challenge myself every day to do something I haven’t done before. I always try to associate myself with people who are better than me so that I can learn from them to make myself better. I believe this approach provides me the opportunity to push my boundaries, which boosts my confidence and gives limitless possibilities to achieve the target and strategic goals, both personal and professional.</p>
